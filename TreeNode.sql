-- Given a table tree, id is identifier of the tree node and p_id is its parent node's id.

-- +----+------+
-- | id | p_id |
-- +----+------+
-- | 1  | null |
-- | 2  | 1    |
-- | 3  | 1    |
-- | 4  | 2    |
-- | 5  | 2    |
-- +----+------+
-- Each node in the tree can be one of three types:
-- Leaf: if the node is a leaf node.
-- Root: if the node is the root of the tree.
-- Inner: If the node is neither a leaf node nor a root node.
